 * A Graph is made up of Vertex objects that hold data values
 * A vertex is connected to other vertices via Edges
 * A vertex can be visited/unvisited
 * Can connect to another vertex via directed edge with weight
 * The edge can be disconnected
 * A vertex cannot have an edge back to itself
 * getNextNeighbor returns the next neighbor each time it is called
 * when there are no more neighbors, the vertex label is returned
